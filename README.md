# Heart Failure Prediction Dataset

## Overview

This repository contains a dataset consisting of clinical records from 5000 patients who experienced heart failure. The data were collected during their follow-up periods and include 13 clinical features that may influence the outcome of heart failure.

## Dataset Details

### Attributes

1. **age**: Age of the patient (years).
2. **anaemia**: Boolean indicating if the patient had a decrease in red blood cells or hemoglobin.
3. **creatinine phosphokinase (CPK)**: Level of the CPK enzyme in the blood (mcg/L).
4. **diabetes**: Boolean indicating if the patient had diabetes.
5. **ejection fraction**: Percentage of blood leaving the heart during each contraction.
6. **high blood pressure**: Boolean indicating if the patient had hypertension.
7. **platelets**: Platelet count in the blood (kiloplatelets/mL).
8. **sex**: Binary variable indicating the gender of the patient (woman or man).
9. **serum creatinine**: Level of serum creatinine in the blood (mg/dL).
10. **serum sodium**: Level of serum sodium in the blood (mEq/L).
11. **smoking**: Boolean indicating if the patient smokes.
12. **time**: Follow-up period (days).
13. **DEATH_EVENT**: Boolean indicating if the patient died during the follow-up period.

### Purpose

The dataset is intended for exploring factors related to heart failure and predicting patient outcomes based on demographic and clinical features.

## Usage

You can use this dataset for:
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand relationships between variables.
- Building predictive models to forecast the likelihood of death due to heart failure.
- Testing and validating machine learning algorithms related to healthcare and clinical predictions.
